# Problem: Two Sum

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
Output: [0, 1]
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Solution Explanation

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a hash map (or JavaScript's `Map` object) to store the elements of the array along with their indices as we iterate through the array. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialization**: Create an empty hash map (`numMap`) to store elements and their corresponding indices.

2. **Iterate Through Array**: Traverse each element `nums[i]` in the array `nums`.

3. **Calculate Complement**: For each element `nums[i]`, calculate its complement `complement = target - nums[i]`.

4. **Check in HashMap**:
   - If the `complement` exists in the `numMap`, it means we have found the pair that sums up to `target`. Return the indices `[numMap.get(complement), i]`.
   - If `complement` does not exist in the `numMap`, store the current element `nums[i]` in the `numMap` with its index `i`.

5. **Edge Cases**: Given the constraints, only one valid solution exists, so the algorithm is designed to find and return that solution efficiently.

## JavaScript Solution

Here is the JavaScript code implementing the above approach:

```javascript
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    let numMap = new Map(); // Create a Map to store numbers and their indices
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        let complement = target - nums[i]; // Calculate complement
        
        if (numMap.has(complement)) {
            return [numMap.get(complement), i]; // Found the solution, return indices
        }
        
        numMap.set(nums[i], i); // Store current number and index in the Map
    }
    
    return []; // If no solution found (though problem guarantees exactly one valid solution)
};

// Example usage:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums, target));  // Output: [0, 1]
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Map Usage**: The `Map` data structure is used to store elements of the array as keys and their indices as values. This allows for efficient lookups to find the complement of the current element.

- **Iterative Approach**: The solution iterates through the array once, making it a linear time complexity \(O(n)\) solution, which is optimal for this problem.

- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays where no valid solution exists due to the problem constraints.

By using a hash map to store and retrieve elements in constant time, this solution efficiently finds the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target.
