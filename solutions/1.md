# LeetCode Q1: Two Sum

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example

Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`

Output: `[0,1]`

Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, the indices of the two numbers are 0 and 1.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a hash map to store the complement of each number as we iterate through the array. We can then check if the complement exists in the hash map. If it does, we have found the two numbers that add up to the target.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty hash map.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the array `nums`.
3. Calculate the complement `complement` by subtracting `num` from the `target`.
4. Check if the `complement` exists in the hash map.
    - If it does, return the indices of `num` and the `complement`.
    - If it doesn't, add `num` to the hash map with its index as the value.
5. If no solution is found, return an empty array.

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity for this approach is O(n) since we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(n) as well, considering the worst-case scenario where all elements are stored in the hash map.
