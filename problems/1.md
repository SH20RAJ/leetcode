# 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
Output: [0, 1]
```

## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Follow-up: 
Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n^2) time complexity?

  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  
  Try to use a hash map to keep track of the numbers you've seen so far and their indices.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
  
  What if the target is twice a number in the array? You need to find two distinct indices.

  <summary>Hint 3</summary>
  
  Use one pass to store the elements and another pass to find the complement.
