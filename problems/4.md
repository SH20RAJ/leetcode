# 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

There are two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(min(m, n))).

You may assume `nums1` and `nums2` cannot be both empty.

## Example 1:

```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

## Example 2:

```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

## Example 3:

```
nums1 = [0, 0]
nums2 = [0, 0]

The median is 0.0
```

## Example 4:

```
nums1 = []
nums2 = [1]

The median is 1.0
```

## Constraints:

- `nums1.length == m`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m <= 1000`
- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m + n <= 2000`
- `-10^6 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^6`

  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  
  Use binary search to partition the arrays `nums1` and `nums2` into two parts such that `left_part` and `right_part` have equal lengths.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
  
  The partitioning index `i` in `nums1` and `j` in `nums2` should satisfy:
  - `left_part` includes elements from `nums1[0]` to `nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[0]` to `nums2[j-1]`.
  - `right_part` includes elements from `nums1[i]` to `nums1[m-1]` and `nums2[j]` to `nums2[n-1]`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 3</summary>
  
  Adjust the partition indices based on binary search conditions to find the median efficiently.
