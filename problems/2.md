# 2. Add Two Numbers

Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

## Example 1:

```
Input: l1 = [2, 4, 3], l2 = [5, 6, 4]
Output: [7, 0, 8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: l1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], l2 = [9, 9, 9, 9]
Output: [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1]
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  
  Simulate the addition process just like how you would sum two numbers on paper. Start from the least significant digit and iterate to the most significant.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
  
  Consider using a dummy node to simplify the code. This is a common trick to avoid handling special cases.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 3</summary>
  
  Keep track of the carry and add it to the sum of the corresponding digits.
