# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Example 4:

```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

## Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.
